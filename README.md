Hello!

This is the place where I keep all of my abandoned and half finished projects that most people dont get to see :P.

Who knows, maybe one day this place will shine! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

If youre bored feel free to send something funny/silly here: RealPhoenixDev@gmail.com

P.s. If life gives you lemons, exploit the natural environment and automate the production for maximum output and maximum efficiency, like a good Ficsit pioneer.
